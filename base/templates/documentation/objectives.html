        <h3>Reusability</h3>
        <p>
            This is priority #1.  The other objectives all exist to aid in this objective.  The
            goal is to make new projects <em>easier</em> and <em>easier</em> - not to add 
            yet another techonology to learn
        </p>
        
        <h3>Concise and Simple</h3>
        <p>
            Even at the cost of run-time efficiency, it should be as simple to use as possible.
            This means it is more likely to be used.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Documented</h3>
        <p>
            If it's not documented, its existence probably won't be noticed.  If it's not
            noticed, it won't be used.  If it's not used, it's not reusable.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Consistent and Familiar</h3>
        <p>
            Base on consistent conventions: when possible behave like other already 
            familiar APIs to reduce the number of new concepts that a user must learn.
